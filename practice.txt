Other people's indecisiveness could leave you feeling frustrated and stuck today, Scorpio. Realize that you can overcome this by pushing past them. Don't feel like you need to wait for others to make up their minds before you act. Do what you need to do, and others will catch up when they're ready. You aren't responsible for the well-being of others. Concentrate on you.

You might just want to stay on the couch today, Taurus. That's fine. Don't get up if you don't want to. You're probably better off sticking close to home and enjoying a good movie tonight. If people ask how you're doing, be honest. Others will be able to see right through you, so don't try to hide your feelings. Today is a good day to say how you really feel.
